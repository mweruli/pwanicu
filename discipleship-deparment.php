										<p class="text-justify">A clear plan of discipleship is needed in all churches but especially crucial in the process of church growth. </p><p class="h4 text-primary text-lighter text-center text-uppercase">Here are three reasons why:</p><p class="h5 text-bolder"> DISCIPLESHIP PLAYS A BIBLICAL ROLE IN CHURCH REVITALIZATION</p><p> The Great Commission calls all Christians to make disciples. Many Christians know Matthew 28:18-20 well. We have heard the passage preached, many have committed it to memory, and we teach it to our children. So why do churches continue to forget their calling?<span>A church that does not make disciples has lost its identity.</span>Discipleship is what has defined the church. Jesus modeled discipleship as he walked with his disciples and taught them about the Kingdom of God. Acts 11:21-26 describes Paul and Barnabas following Jesus’ example by making disciples in the early church. The church is defined by this Great Commission to make disciples; making disciples is our identity.</p><p class="h5"> DISCIPLESHIP PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN REVITALIZATION</p><p>In this consumer culture, it is understandable how the church can be caught up emphasizing programs their culture desires. If a church is a traditional Christian context, they may focus on remaining traditional in their worship style. If the church is in an area with young families, they may focus their energy on making the children’s ministry fun and exciting. While it is perfectly okay to contextualize ministry for the culture, a church must be diligent in keeping discipleship the focus of the ministries. After all, what happens if a church loses its vision to make disciples? A church that does not make disciples has missed the reason for which they exist. The truth is, the business of the church is to make disciples. While some churches may be great at implementing many different programs for consumers, if they are not making disciples, they are missing their purpose.</p>
