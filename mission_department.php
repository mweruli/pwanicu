											“Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...”Greetings! I hope you are safe and still holding on to the living hope of our LORD Jesus. Great glory and honor to the Lord for He has fully sanitized our hearts forever, making us perfect even as we sanitize our hands on the other side. Every season has its sides. No Matter how striking and challenging it may be, there must always be something good about it. </p>

											<p class="text-justify">The COVID 19 pandemic came along with a lot! Like a mounting flood, it swept across the whole world with great vigor! Some companies scrambled while others sprouted and moved a notch higher. Some people went mourning and suffering whereas on the other side, others became richer and more joy came their way. The church was not left behind its doors were closed and the “normal noises” from church buildings of people singing and others praising, could no longer be heard on worship days as it had been the custom.</p> 

											<p class="text-justify">People watched sermons on television, listened to radios, or even attended practices and fellowships via online platforms such as zoom, WhatsApp, and other platforms that they had never come to think that one day would be that place they meet for fellowship. It is all done as man seeks to fulfill the scriptures which says, never to forsake the fellowship of believers. Pwani CU was not left behind. From the time the university gates were closed, we have strived to stay together in the fellowship of brethren and used online platforms to hold on together encouraging each other even as the day of salvation approaches! Thanks to Focus Kenya, the Christian union officials, and the executive committee who have worked together to ensure that this church does not forsake the fellowship of brethren.
